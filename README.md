# Diabetes-Data
Data Analysis Project to predict the probability of having diabetes among the Pima Indian heritage population.

Context: This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years of age of Pima Indian heritage.

Content of the dataset: The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, etc.

We have 768 rows and 9 columns. The first 8 columns represent the features and the last column represents the target/label.

Methods: I used the Pandas library in Python for data cleaning and analysis. I also used the Matplotlib library for basic visualization.

Step by step process:
•	Importing and reading of the data

•	Statistical overview of the data: mean, median, percentiles, etc.

•	Identifying and handling missing values

•	Counting of missing values in each column

•	Checking of correct data format

•	Basic Data visualization


•	Saving the new file in CSV format.

In addition, I used PowerBI in creating dashboards for advanced visualization.

Conclusions:

	65.10% of the sample population are diabetic. 34.90% of the sample population are not diabetic.

	Glucose, blood pressure, and insulin levels have higher tendencies to increase with age.

	The measure of skin thickness does not correlate with possible health risks.

	A high Body Mass Index (BMI) shows a high probability of being diabetic.

	A greater number of populations between age 41 and 60 have diabetes.

	People with a higher number of pregnancies have a higher probability of being diabetic.
